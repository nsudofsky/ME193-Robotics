Short jingles used to announce the match outcome: a success fanfare for
whoever wins the point, a death song for whoever loses it. Playable
either through the *computer's* speakers (synthesized with numpy,
play_success_song()/play_death_song()) or through the LEGO hub's own
speaker (play_success_song_on_hub(dm)/play_death_song_on_hub(dm)), using
the same note sequences either way.
